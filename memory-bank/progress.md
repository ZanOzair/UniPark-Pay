## ðŸ”„ REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION WITH CLARIFICATIONS

### Parking Area System
- [ ] **PARKING AREA VALIDATION**: Check GPS within pre-defined areas (meters calculation)
- [ ] **MAP INTEGRATION**: Display current location on OpenStreetMap with flutter_map
- [ ] **PARKING AREA DETECTION**: Determine which area user is in (first match wins)
- **Clarifications**:
  - Distance calculated in meters using Haversine formula
  - No GPS accuracy threshold required
  - First matching area is considered valid (no overlap handling)

### QR Payment System
- [ ] **STATIC QR DISPLAY**: Show single admin-uploaded QR code to guests (RM1/hour)
- [ ] **PAYMENT PROOF UPLOAD**: PNG image upload for bank transfer proof
- [ ] **ADMIN REVIEW INTERFACE**: Approve/reject guest parking sessions
- [ ] **SESSION STATUS TRACKING**: approved/unverified/rejected states
- **Clarifications**:
  - Single QR code only (latest admin upload overwrites)
  - RM1 per hour rate for guests
  - Admin split view: guests vs lecturer/student sessions
  - No push notifications (manual status checking)

### User Expiry Handling
- [x] **EXPIRY CHECK**: Auto-delete expired students/lecturer on login/startup
- [x] **RE-REGISTRATION PROMPT**: Guide expired users to re-register
- **Clarifications**:
  - Guest and admin accounts: permanent (no expiry)
  - Student/lecturer: delete user and all associated parking sessions
  - Trigger on both login and app startup

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS WITH CLARIFICATIONS

1. **Parking Area Validation**: Implement GPS distance calculation against pre-defined areas
   - Use Haversine formula for meter calculations
   - First matching area wins (no overlap logic)
   - No GPS accuracy filtering

2. **Map Integration**: Add flutter_map for location visualization
   - OpenStreetMap tiles
   - Current location marker
   - Parking area boundaries display
   - Offline capability available

3. **QR Payment Flow**: Complete guest payment system
   - RM1 per hour rate
   - Single QR code display
   - Payment proof upload (PNG/JPEG/WebP)
   - Admin review interface with split view

4. **Admin Session Review**: Interface for reviewing guest parking sessions
   - Split view: guest sessions (paid) vs lecturer/student (free)
   - Map display of session locations
   - Payment proof image viewer
   - Status update controls

## ðŸ“Š TECHNICAL QUALITY

### Architecture Patterns
- **FutureBuilder-Only**: All async operations use FutureBuilder
- **No Mounted Checks**: Following Flutter best practices
- **Centralized Validation**: ValidationUtils used across all forms
- **Singleton Patterns**: LocationService, DatabaseManager, AuthManager, UserManager
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper separation of user permissions
- **Plain Text Storage**: By design for simplicity

### Code Quality
- **Consistent error handling** across all components
- **Loading states** for all async operations
- **Clean separation of concerns** between UI and business logic
- **Reusable components** (IdentityCard, ContentPage, etc.)
- **No technical debt** in current implementation

## ðŸš€ READY FOR NEXT PHASE

The core application infrastructure is complete and stable. All foundational systems are implemented and tested. The remaining work focuses on specific feature additions rather than architectural improvements.

### Clarified Implementation Details
- **Payment Rate**: RM1 per hour for guests
- **Currency**: Malaysian Ringgit (RM)
- **QR Code**: Single static code, admin update only
- **GPS Units**: Meters for all distance calculations
- **File Uploads**: No size limits, no virus scanning
- **Error Recovery**: Manual retry with clear error messages
- **Account Expiry**: Students/lecturer only, cascades to parking sessions
- **Guest Extension**: Manual new session creation required

### Future Development (Out of Scope)
- Excel report generation
- Database backup procedures
- Push notifications
- Multiple payment methods
- Advanced GPS accuracy filtering
- Data retention policies
